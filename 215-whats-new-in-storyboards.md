**Link:** [https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/?id=215](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/?id=215)

**Sample:** [https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/samplecode/SegueCatalog/Introduction/Intro.html](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/samplecode/SegueCatalog/Introduction/Intro.html)

The video starts with a short presentation of a sample application...5 minutes of boring.

**New feature:** with Xcode7 is possible to link two different storyboards using "storyboard references"

Is possible to split the storyboard selecting the viewcontrollers we need to move and select "refactor to storyboard" from the edit menu.

Now is possible to create custom views that are not part of the view hierarchy and show these views directly on storyboard.


## Customizing custom segues
With iOS9 user can select a type of segue (like "modal") and specify a custom transition. This means that on the code implementation will be possible to call the "[super perform]".
